# Integrated-Stock-Prediction-and-Trading-Signal-System-ISP-TSS-
Integrated Stock Prediction and Trading Signal System (ISP-TSS) is a comprehensive tool that combines advanced financial analysis, machine learning models, and macroeconomic data to predict stock prices and generate actionable buy/sell signals

This project integrates multiple layers of analysis, including:

Technical Indicators: Key financial indicators like Moving Averages (MA), Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Bollinger Bands are calculated to identify trends and signals.
Macroeconomic Data: Incorporates critical macroeconomic factors such as GDP, inflation rates, and interest rates to understand broader market conditions and their impact on stock prices.
Machine Learning Models: Uses machine learning algorithms (such as LSTM and ARIMA) to predict future stock prices based on historical data, combined with technical and macroeconomic insights.
Sentiment Analysis: Scrapes financial news data and conducts sentiment analysis to further refine buy/sell signals, adding a qualitative perspective to quantitative analysis.
Features:
Multi-Indicator Analysis: Combines technical indicators and macroeconomic data to assess stock performance.
Machine Learning Predictions: Predicts future stock prices using a combination of LSTM and ARIMA models.
Trading Signals: Generates buy/sell signals based on predictions, technical indicators, and macroeconomic conditions.
Visualization Dashboard: Provides interactive charts and dashboards to visualize stock trends, predictions, and signals.
Real-Time Data Integration: Leverages live data from financial APIs and macroeconomic data sources for real-time analysis.
Technologies Used:
Python: Core programming language for data analysis, scraping, and model training.
Plotly: For creating interactive visualizations and dashboards.
LSTM & ARIMA: Machine learning models for predicting stock prices.
BeautifulSoup/Selenium: For scraping financial news and data.
APIs: Used for retrieving stock market data and macroeconomic indicators (e.g., yfinance, CoinMarketCap).
Potential Use Cases:
Traders & Investors: Offers a data-driven approach for generating reliable trading signals.
Financial Analysts: Provides a tool for analyzing stock performance by considering both market indicators and macroeconomic conditions.
Machine Learning Enthusiasts: A platform to explore the intersection of financial data and machine learning models.
